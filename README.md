# Job to Candidate matching logic
Job SkillTags: Skill 1, Skill 2, Skill 3

Candidate 1 Skills: Skill 2, Skill 1, Skill 5

Candidate 2 Skills: Skill 1, Skill 5, Skill 6

Candidate 2 Skills: Skill 5, Skill 6, Skill 1

Match priority: 
	
	1) Find candidates: Candidate first skill = Job first skill
	
		1.1 Found. 
		
				Find candidates: Candidate first skill = Job second skill
				
			1.1.1 Found
			
					Find candidates: Candidate first skill = Job third skill
					
					...continue
					
					"Return one candidate."
					
		1.2 Not Found:
		
				Find candidates: Candidate second skill = Job second skill
				
				1.2.1 Found: Similar to 1.1.1
				
		... continue
		
		Return "Candidate not found"
		
			
	2) Not found: 
		Find candidates: Candidate second skill = Job first skill

	3) Not found: 
		Continue with Candidate third, fourth,... skill
		
	4) Not found 
			Return "Candidate not found"
