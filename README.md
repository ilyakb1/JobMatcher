# Requirements

**JobAdder Coding Challenge**

For this exercise, we’d like you to create a web application that will help a recruiter automatically match candidates to open jobs. 
Within your UI, (the form the interface takes is open to your interpretation), for each job, display a candidate that is the most-qualified to fill that job.
There are many approaches with how this task could be achieved but it will be up to you to analyse and determine what you think is a good way to match a candidate to a job and present it to the UI.
API documentation can be found in the following location: https://jobadder1.docs.apiary.io/# 

**Notes**
1.	The solution should take between 3-4 hours. Time-box if you can’t complete the challenge in a reasonable timeframe. Your solution does not have to be code and feature complete, but will serve as the basis for the final interview.

2.	Add any and all assumptions you make about the problem and/or solution to the README file. Include a brief description of how you decided to match a candidate to a job. 

3.	Store your code in a git repository (e.g. Github or BitBucket) - we want to see the evolution of your solution through your commits, so commit early and often.

4.	Solutions should be inclusive, with instructions to build and run in a README file. There should be at least some evidence of testing.

5.	We are a C#/.NET shop and are looking for a solution written in .NET. We also use Angular in-house but don’t mind the frontend technology you choose. 
A database solution, e.g. MSSQL Server, shouldn’t be required.
